## Project overview
Create a python virtual board of game of Nim and a python bot that can play the game versus human player (read more about the game here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim).
The bot's decision is built based on the optimal strategy (of Nim-sum, check out my presentation video below for more detail)
